# Experimental lezer-julia

The thing I'm trying here is adding whitespace into the tree...
because Julia has a couple of specific whitespace handling stuff, so I figured huh maybe it'd work.

I work on this in the lezer playground, but I put it here so I also have it in case I ruin the lezer playground.
